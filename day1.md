# Integration

$$ A = \sum^{n}_{i=1} $$
$$ \lim$$

## Anti Derivative

$$ f(x) -> F(x) $$
$$ F'(x) = f(x) $$
$$ g(x) = x^2 $$
$$ g'(x) = 2x $$

- If you take the deriv of it you get the function you started with. 
- When you get the integral you are just finding an anti-derivative

$$ x^n $$ 
becomes
$$ (x^(n+1))/n+1 $$

$$\frac{1}{n+1} \times x^(n+1) $$ becomes $$

$$\int^{b}_{a} f(x)d(x) = F(b) - F(a)$$

- Where F() is any antiderivative of f()
---
- if
  - $$g(x) = \int^{x}_{a} f(t)dt$$
- then
  - $$g'(x) = f(x)$$

### examples 

#### Example 1

$$ \int^{2\pi}_{\pi} \cos \theta d\theta  = \sin{2\pi + c} - \sin{\pi+c} = 0-0 = 0$$

<!-- #### Example 2 -->
<!-- $$ \int^{-1}_{-2} (4y^2 + \frac{2}{y^3}) dy $$
$$ \int^{-1}_{-2} (4y^2  dy + \int^{-1}_{-2} \frac{2}{y^3}) $$
$$ 4\int^{-1}_{-2} (y^2  dy + 2 \int^{-1}_{-2} \frac{1}{y^3}) $$
$$ 4(1/3)y^3 $$ -->

### Steps to get an integral

- any $y^2$ where $n = -1$ the integral is  $1/(n+1) y^(n+1)$

1. Try to break down the function
2. try to factor our multipliers from each integral
3. Apply above rule. 
4. simplify

### Tips and Tricks
- Try to simplify a quotient in any way possible before splitting it.
- Use trig idents sparingly (use sin/cos as much as possible)
- In the context of rate of change the integral is the total distance traveled.
- Keep track of what you factor out. 
- Pay attention to powers that are not written
- $$\frac{1}{kx} = \frac{1}{k}\times x$$
