# Integration

$$ \int f(g(x))(g'(x))dx = \int f(u)du $$
$$ u = g(x) $$
$$ \frac{du}{dx} = g'(x) $$
$$ du = g'(x)dx $$

- $u$ is differentiable on $I$

## Steps

- Pick something to be the u substitution
- Find the derivative of u
- factor out any constants
- Integrate in terms of u
- 


## Tips and tricks. 

- Check rule of logs/natural logs. 
  - record them in tech journal 
- turn trig funtions into their base forms.
